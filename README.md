## When do I need to create an Issue?

Please **create** an issue if:
- you encounter a **bug**,
- want to see a **feature** implemented,
- have any **questions**,
- or see an improvement of our **documentation**.

## What if I don't have a GitHub account?

If don't have and/or want to create a GitHub account to create an issue, please feel free to use any of the other contact channels mentioned [here](https://www.joinself.com/contact-us).

## How are Issues dealt with?

The application is provided for use as is and the development, and roadmap, is driven by the company needs and time availability.

We try getting back to you as soon as possible and, therefore, it is necessary for you to include as much information as you can. This way we can ensure a timely and targeted response.
However, due to aforementioned constraints, we kindly ask for your patience.

## How can I influence the Roadmap?

First and foremost, the roadmap is driven by the company needs.

You can influence the roadmap by **creating feature requests** and, especially, **upvoting** existing requests!

If **demand** for a feature increases, it will gain **priority** over others.

## Where can I find a Roadmap?

At the moment, there is **no** roadmap available **publicly**.

Stay tuned for any updates on that.

## What if I have other enquiries?

If you have other enquiries, feel free to use the channels mentioned [here](https://www.joinself.com/contact-us).
